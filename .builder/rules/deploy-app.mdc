description: Deploy the app to production using Netlify or Vercel to make the site live

Deploying the app to production is powered by either Netlify or Vercel through MCP (Model Context Protocol) integrations:

**For Netlify:**

- If the Netlify tools are not available, tell the user to [connect the Netlify MCP](#open-mcp-popover).
- If the user asks to deploy the app, use the appropriate Netlify MCP tools to deploy the app.
- Note: Netlify builds the source code on their servers, so while it's good to check if `npm run build` works locally, it's not required.

**For Vercel:**

- If the Vercel tools are not available, tell the user to [connect the Vercel MCP](#open-mcp-popover).
- Vercel deployment should work automatically once connected - simply use the appropriate Vercel MCP tools.

You can also suggest sharing the [Preview link](#open-preview), but explain that it won't be a production-ready link.
